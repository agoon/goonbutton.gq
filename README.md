## What is goonbutton.gq?
goonbutton.gq is a simple take on a classic flash game that I played when I was younger called Ragdoll Avalanche. In goonbutton.gq, you are a blue square who can move left and right as well as jump using a, d, and w respectively. The main goal of the game is to dodge as many falling squares as possible, as each falling square that passes through the floor beneath you counts as 1 point to your score. The control flow of the game is based around the use of a blue button at the bottom of the screen, which will act as a start and restart button. The button also provides you with a canvas clear during the game; if you find yourself overwhelmed during the game you can click the button and clear the canvas of falling squares and give yourself a breather. Be careful not to carelessly use this power, as it is on cooldown for 30 seconds after use!

## Why will you love it?
You will love goonbutton.gq because of it's simplicity. I personally love games that feel clean to play and have simple, but fun objectives. I made goonbutton.gq in the spirit of these two ideals, and I have to say that it really is fun and easy to play. Along with this, the game relies on the button at the bottom of the screen, which should definitely make any Button employee excited!

## Why do I want to intern at Button?
I want to intern at Button because I've heard excellent things about the work environment and corporate culture. I want to get experience working in the software startup industry, and Button seems to be the perfect startup to do so. Being based in NYC makes Button even more appealing, as I am originally from New Jersey and would love to spend the summer back home (takes the burden off of finding housing). Along with having a great environment, I know Button has extremely talented employees that I could learn a great deal from, whether it be through improving my technical prowess or absorbing life wisdom. Finally, I find Button's product very interesting, and want to contribute to it to help mobile developers and companies connect and create more seamless experience in the growing world of smartphones. Button provides an impeccable array of benefits that make me really excited about the opportunity to intern there!
