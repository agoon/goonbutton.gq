## What is goonbutton.gq?
goonbutton.gq is a simple take on a classic flash game that I played when I was younger called Ragdoll Avalanche. In goonbutton.gq, you are a blue square who can move left and right as well as jump using a, d, and w respectively. The main goal of the game is to dodge as many falling squares as possible, as each falling square that passes through the floor beneath you counts as 1 point to your score. The control flow of the game is based around the use of a blue button at the bottom of the screen, which will act as a start and restart button. The button also provides you with a canvas clear during the game; if you find yourself overwhelmed during the game you can click the button and clear the canvas of falling squares and give yourself a breather. Be careful not to carelessly use this power, as it is on cooldown for 30 seconds after use!
